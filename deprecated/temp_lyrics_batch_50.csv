Everybody's looking for who they are
Those who know don't have the words to tell
And the ones with the words don't know too well

Oh, could be the famine
Could be the feast
Could be the pusher
Could be the priest
Always ourselves we love the least
That's the burden of the angel/beast

Birds of paradise—birds of prey
Here tomorrow, gone today
Cross my forehead, cross my palm
Don't cross me or I'll do you harm

Oh, could be the famine
Could be the feast
Could be the pusher
Could be the priest
Always ourselves we love the least
That's the burden of the angel/beast

We go crying, we come laughing
Never understand the time we're passing
Kill for money, die for love
Whatever was God thinking of?

Oh, could be the famine
Could be the feast
Could be the pusher
Could be the priest

Eyes like moonlight on barbed wire
And veins showing under the skin
The uniforms made me nervous
I got ready for the chase
But they left me scanning these crowds for some sign of your face

Something fell on Saskatchewan in 1885
Where is it now that we need it
In this century of jive?
The axe falls as if through water
Never leaves a trace
And I'm scanning these crowds for some sign of your face

The world shot down love as a spy, once upon a time ago
Now people stand around here
Like crows in the snow
Like the shadow of the rope on Louis Riel
They look so clean out of place
And I'm scanning these crowds for some sign of your face

Though storms may still kiss the grasslands with primal fire
In the land of passive revolution
Everything's for hire
Are they demons, are they lemmings
Or just the humans in this place?

When your hands are full of thorns
But you can't quit groping for the rose

Take your rest with me

When thoughts you've tried to leave behind
Keep sniping from the dark
When the fire burns inside you but
You jump from every spark
When your heart's beset by memories
You wish you'd never made
When the sun comes up an enemy
And nothing gives you shade

In the southland of the heart
Where the saints go lazily
Lie down
Take your rest with me
Lie down
Take your rest with me

When the preacher lays his insight down
And claims to lead the blind
When those you trust just get you hooked
And trifle with your mind
When the nightmare's creeping closer
And your wheels are in the mud
When everything's ambiguous
Except the taste of blood

In the southland of the heart

No one's at the door
You suggest a ghost, perhaps a phantom

Sure I'm glad you're on my side still

Even a glamorous bitch can be in need
This is where you know the honey from the killer bees

White shell beads wrapped around her
Skin - a life-giving river

She may betray all she loves
And even wait for their savior to come
And in some things, maybe he'll be right
But, as always, the thing that he loves
He will change from her
Sunwise to clockwise to soul trading
Still she'll lay down her body
Covering him all the same

So hundreds of years go by
The red road carved up by sharp knife
She's a girl out working her trade
And she loses a little each day
To ghetto pimps and presidents
Who try and arouse her turquoise serpents
She can't recall what they represent
And when you ask, she won't know

She will betray all she loves
And even wait for their Savior to come
And in some things, maybe he'll be right

There beneath a veil of gray

To fly the flag half-mast

Never saw an angry mob

It's a worldwide ring with the style we bring, right?
So watch the dime drop as I harvest my crop
Cause I'm going to ride this to the top, ha-ha-ha

Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it), so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
My time's the only thing that you have taken
So above the world, don't be mistaken, so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
You've lost the only thing that you were given
Afraid to stand alone, so now you're tripping, so
Get back, get back, get back",https://genius.com/Zebrahead-get-back-lyrics,success
1ThKFoMgBmSy6IzZCx7RkM,The Real Me,zebrahead,1316953.0,The Real Me,Zebrahead,"I know a girl who welcomes the world
I think though the world is spoiled
(And she, holds on to me)
(She holds my head up so that I can breathe)
And I've found that when I'm on the ground
She is the only one still sticking around
(Only she, knows the real me)
(And I know that she won't let me down)
And I get mine, and I get mine
And I get mine, and I get mine
And I, get mine, and I get mine
And I get, mine
No way I could ever leave today
'Cause she listens to the dumb things that I say
(And I, seem to get high)
(With just one smile as she walks on by)
And I found that when I'm on the ground
She is the only one sticking around
(Only she, knows the real me)
(And I know that she won't let me down)
There's only one girl in this world who understands the real me
There's nothing superficial, artificial, you get just what you see
I know a girl, who takes up my world
Takes all of me, and every breath that I hold
(We meet, and she makes me feel free)
(With one look she knows just what I need)
And I've found that she's got me bound
She is the only one that my mind surrounds
(Only she, knows the real me)
(And I know that she won't let me down)
And I get mine, And I get mine
And I get mine, And I get mine
And I, get mine, And I get mine
There's only one girl in this world who understands the real me
There's nothing, superficial, artificial, you get just what you see
There's only one girl in this world who understands the real me
There's nothing, superficial, artificial, you get just what you see
(Oh, yeah)
I know a girl who wakes up my world
Brings in the warmth, when I'm feeling cold
And she's got places to be
But she says, that she would rather stay here with me
And I've found that when I'm on the ground
She is the only one sticking around
Only she, knows the real me
And I know that she won't let me down
And I get mine, And I get mine
And I get mine, And I get mine
And I, get mine, And I get mine
There's only one girl in this world who understands the real me
There's nothing, superficial, artificial, you get just what you see
There's only one girl in this world who understands the real me
There's nothing, superficial, artificial, you get just what you see",https://genius.com/Zebrahead-the-real-me-lyrics,success

Late out the door
Grab my clothes off the floor
Backpack and books
'Cause school is a chore
Coming straight down the block
Punk rock ain't no shock
Blue hair everywhere
'Cause we've got the stock
Slide by all the narcs
As the late alarm barks
Take a nap in the class
On a film about, sharks
Try to make my way through
But is all I can do
'Cause I keep coming back and
All I think about is you
Didn't want to go, didn't want to stay, didn't want to lie, by my side
I don't really care 'cause I'll still be there swallowing my pride
Someday I'm going to be there
Someday I'm going to be there
Step out in the hall
With the girls dressed like dolls
And the burn-outs are baked
'Cause they step out the stalls
See the games that they play
'Cause they practice all day
And the more than I see
Is the less I have to say
It's a quarter by ten
By your locker again
'Cause I know you'll be coming round the corner with your friend
Try to make my way through
But is all I can do
'Cause I keep coming back and
All I think about is you
Didn't want to go, didn't want to stay, didn't want to lie, by my side
I don't really care 'cause I'll still be there swallowing my pride
Someday I'm going to be there
Someday I'm going to be there
Listen when I say today is the day
Today is the day and I'm on my way
Listen when I say today is the day
Today is the day and I'm on my way
Listen when I say today is the day (I see you when you're wandering by)
Today is the day and I'm on my way (And you still catch my eye, blow my mind)
Listen when I say today is the day
Today is the day and I'm on my way ('Cause my face you won't recognize)
Yeah, I know that's crazy
How you seem to phase me
When nothing else matters but
That all escapes me
This is a new trip
Got to get a better grip
A day in the life
And you know I'm gonna take it
And then you turn and walk away
Before I have a chance to say
I know that you can make this
All okay
Try to make my way through
But is all I can do
'Cause I keep coming back and
All I think about is you
Didn't want to go, didn't want to stay, didn't want to lie, by my side
I don't really care 'cause I'll still be there swallowing my pride
Someday I'm going to be there
Someday I'm going to be there
Listen when I say today is the day
Today is the day and I'm on my way
Listen when I say today is the day
Today is the day and I'm on my way
Listen when I say today is the day
Today is the day and I'm on my way
Listen when I say today is the day (I see you when you're wandering by)
Today is the day and I'm on my way (And you still catch my eye, blow my mind)
Listen when I say today is the day

Bear all the times that I miss and hit the ground
Time is the key and it's holding
I won't get burned 'cause regret is scolding
So I find that this is just a waste of my mind
To think of the days gone by and all the things I want to try
And everyone says get your head out of the clouds
And all I want to do is play loud (loud, loud, loud...)
Break it, break it down
There's funk in the sound
I'm gonna live my life fly and keep my feet off the ground
And I'm not the only one when I see
You got your feet bound to the ground when you should be living free
So you get the feeling that I waste another day
Now I got the feeling that I'm not the only one
If you think about it, it's a waste of mind, 'cause
Try to live without it and you'll stop
Check out the rhythm
I think about the time when everyone will hear me
Hear my rhymes loud and understand clearly
That I can spend each and every day
Doing things my way and I'll be okay
But I find that this is just a waste of my mind
To think of the days gone by and all the things I want to try
And everyone says get your head out of the clouds
And all I want to do is play loud
So you get the feeling that I waste another day
Now I got the feeling that I'm not the only one
If you think about it, it's a waste of mind, 'cause
Try to live without it and you'll stop
Check out the lead
So you get the feeling that I waste another day
Now I got the feeling that I'm not the only one
If you think about it, it's a waste of mind, 'cause
Try to live without it and you'll stop",https://genius.com/Zebrahead-waste-of-mind-lyrics,success

All that I need is mind emancipation
Got to find a way to get away
Got to find something to make me want to stay

Stressed cause of strain and you know that I'm leaving today (so)
