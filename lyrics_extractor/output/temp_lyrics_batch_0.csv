Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized

On northern land, as human contraband
Some rico from Jalisco passed her name to the Boss
She stuffed into a truckbed, she clutches her cross
Here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
Of Yanqui guns for blood, debts on the loans
Of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
Of graves hidden, trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

To tear away at the mask

And now she got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
His presence, it terrifies and eclipses her days
No minutes to rest, no moments to pray
And with a whisper he whips her, her soul chained to his will
""My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill""
Her arms jerk, the sisters gather 'round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear (Maria)

Never conquered but here

Bring that shit in, uh!
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh!

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down
Aw shit

Uh!
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh!

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

To try and find a clear way through

It's been a while since I played the fool
'Cause they said, ""Raise your game, leave the shame
In this place where you will remain unless you save your soul""
Now it's going my way, forget the time that I did then
Now it's going my way, I look and everything's okay
Got nothing much to say except the life that I now lead
Is going my way, going my way

The whole day wrapped up in my dreams
It took a while upstaging misery, it isn't all it seems
Now I smooth my hair feeling tight
I'm getting into something right
Living beyond those days

Waitin' for the sun to shine on what we do believe in
In every man I hear the cry of someone else
A drownin' man reachin' out but no one hears
I know a man livin' out his life without a reason
And he says
Monday's got a beautiful baby
And Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child, he was born to give
Now what about all the unborn people that will suffer
At the hands of Mr. Right who cares about no other
I see a mother who lets her children use her up
I know a father who just sacrificed his wayward son
I wonder what you give that someone else is needin'
Next to nothin'
Monday's got a beautiful baby
Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child, he was born to give
Monday's got a beautiful baby
Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child, this here you say

It's not the laughter of a man in pain

It's not the laughter of a frightened mind

Balanced on the brink only waiting for a shove
You better listen for the laugh of love
Balanced on the brink only waiting for a shove
You better listen for the laugh of love

It's not the laughter of the gloating rich
It's not the laughter of the sacred bitch
It's not the laughter of the macho fool
It's not the laughter that obeys the rules

More of a chainsaw in a velvet glove
You better listen for the laugh of love
More of a chainsaw in a velvet glove
You better listen for the laugh of love

It's not the laughter of a child with toys
It's not the laughter of the President's boys
It's not the laughter of the media king

It's the wind in the wings of a diving dove

Moaning somewhere near

Hard to believe it's happening
But my whole world's shrunken to

Like looking through glass
Could be looking at me
Could be looking right past

I can't tell which is true
But I wouldn't trade the world
For that picture of you

Moon in the water
Cold light in the streets
Warmth in your fingers
Sweat in your sheets
Laid out like an offering
Where two currents meet
The river is dark
But the water is sweet

Wailing on the mountain
Smoke on the wind
Can't drown out the whisper
Or the scent of your skin
Don't know where it came from
