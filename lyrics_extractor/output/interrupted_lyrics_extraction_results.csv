Ain't no bitch is this industry that can see me
The city of C-H-I is where I'm from
The 3rd motherfucker to drop the bomb on the bomb
And here I come steady breakin bustas off
Up to bat is Da Brat and ain't a damn thing soft
About me, no doubt the B-R-A-T
Is all up in that ass for the motherfuckin ninety's
So funkdafied who can be this lady
Brat westside bustin like a 380
From the top of my head to the sole of my feet
Broke down smoked out locced out is she
That bitch that'll hit ya get ya
And when you bumpin up my shit may da funk be wit 'cha

Fall into the groove of the waxin
Let my music take you high-e-i
Lay back kick it and enjoy the ride
And move that body from side to side
Fall into the groove of the waxin
Let my music take you high-e-i
Lay back kick it and enjoy the ride
And move that body from side to side

A real fresh voice over top of low frequency
Is the chain like connection between you and me
Why? Cause I got that bump de de bump
And baby you got them humps in your trunk
So it's on (Shit)
Lay back nigga we fin to ride
I gotta get high I gotta get mine
Baptized all up in this funky shit
Fired up is that bitch that you just can't funk with
I got what you need do you wanna fly?
This is your brain on drugs and I
Have been captured taken over by
The captivating strength of the most funkdafied high
It's like fire locked in my bones
Get smoked the fuck out it's the funk bring it on (oh yeah)
And that's how I hit ya
And when you bumpin up my shit may da funk be wit 'cha

Hypnotized by a motherfucker puttin it down
It's Da Brat watch your back when I'm in your town
Cause I gotta be funky I gotta be me
I gotta be that same bitch from the streets
A woman of my clad
Commin up with the motherfucking funk so I know my track
Right, can you feel it do you hear what I hear
Nothin but the funk bumpin up in your ear
Double S-O definitely
So locced out that it's just so s-o crazy
Brat on that ass fallin back once more
Getting filled on full with that shit from the ghetto
You better ask somebody if you don't know
I'm from Chicago and you can't fade this ho
And that's how I get ya
And when you bumpin up my shit nigga take the funk wit 'cha

Of a lifetime overnight
You think you're so immortal
So eternal, out of sight

Aren't the ones you wanna hear
Alone inside your narrow mind

Tears you up inside and (Inside)

You smiled at me and said
""I wanna prove I love you, but does that mean I have to walk on water?""

It is enough when I say things aren't so simple
Hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on
Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing is like before

When it was still okay to want it

Bad dreams, sweethearts, twin beds

Eating bully-beef and drinking the weak coffee
And it was Anderson's luck that held him out for this long
From the city he smelled wood smoke and wondered how she did alone
At night she huddles tight around the wood stove
Listening to radio free, waiting for the distant low sounds
Of the big guns waking up for the evening
And it's just a nuisance, a shame that she's used to it

Winter's on now
He's been months down
To the fighting for the city
She plays a mean game of hide and seek through the back streets
She makes a careful way past frozen eyes under dirty sheets
She knows the moment when it comes, ain't nothing more than pure luck
A great blinding instant then you rise up above it all

Winter's on now
How much longer
Can she hold out in the city

People open wide your eyes to this day dawning
People open wide your arms to your brothers
People open wide your eyes to what's going on
And pray, yeah
It was Anderson's luck to be there when it happened
He was on a short leave, they drank weak coffee by the wood stove
As the low moan of cannon came calling from the mountains
Perhaps they heard the shot come knocking on their door

Winter's on now
There ain't no wood anyhow
They laid them under dirty sheets

The ten o'clock news is on
In the mouth of the mountains the city lies still under siege
My wife reads quiet at the firelight
I turn it off, step outside for wood from a fallen tree

Winter's on now
I got coffee on
My kids sleep safely in the city

Or Womb Fever. June Cleaver never suffered
She had the penicillin, no expiration when she mothered
Her no-good little death-proof brats
Living little ones once were preciouser than that
Living anybody used to be a miracle, yo
You’d get et by the festering hysterical flow
Of madnesses and bad diseases of mole
Lung, eye, and humor, spirit and soul
All these afflictions engender aversions:
I catch Green Sickness to match with the virgins;
Scrofula coughs that I cast askance;
Ever since Black Scurvy, I can’t wear pants
And I can’t but dance with glee that it’s not then now
“I bet you got the Tarantism.” – and how!

Maybe you’ll never die
Maybe you’re going to live forever
And never have anything wrong with you
And until you do
You won’t worry about it

Give out a shout to the Cholera. Doubt you
Could follow a charting of the manifold ways I’m ill:
Iliac Passion, Spelter's Chill
Weaver's Bottom, and a Melancholy Ache
If my fever doesn’t break, raise a glass at the wake


Yea verily, shouldn’t ought to put in the belly
Ague Cake with the Colloid Jelly

Before my world come to an end, I go and cop me a Benz
600, ride around and get blunted
All my past enemies, they gon get hunted
Make love to my woman, she get it how she want it
Take my kids to Disney World, like I won the Superbowl
Plus I beat my court case, because a loop hole
Exotic flavors, always keep the fruit rolled
My bulletproof block shots, like Manute Bol
You can’t hit me, be in Houston like I’m Whitney
Spear you like Brittany, put a knife in your kidney
Godfather run game, like the Globetrotters
I should run for President, like I’m Jimmy Carter
Over the waters, coke smuggled through the harbors
In the states we transport it through somebody’s daughter

Before my world comes to an end, I’m going out with my men
Screwed Up Click, setting a trend
In the Lex or the Benz, steady spending the ends
Getting up with yellow bones, have ‘em calling they friends

Before my world ends, I wanna push a pearl Benz
On 20 inch Lorenz, that spin like whirlwinds
Hugging my girlfriend, that’s black and plastic
And she doesn’t mind, putting these haters in caskets
Put a cheddar to cheese, and velveeta I mash quick
I came in this game, first round draft pick
Taking your bitches, making my riches
Bracelets frostbit, so you can skate on my wristses
Pretty hoes see me pull up, in 4.6's
And that’s when they get mad, wishing it was two Chris's
On tracks I’m vicious, untamed and malicious
In they face, blowing up like air bags and bubble-licious
Serving you flows, like Papa Deauxxx main dishes
Getting funds by the tons, while the dope game switches
I make it senseless, to end up dead or in the FED
When I can spit lyrical heroin, and make bread


You bitches pathetic, you niggas polished synthetic
Cake mix and flour, make up your genetics
Call the paramedics, shit’s about to get hectic
Fin to light up your spot, like General Electric
Dead End Texas, the best with pitched bird
I done flooded the Suburb', with fifty featherless birds
My game blast superb, Gucci shoes and Iceberg
Since it’s all about the End, I have the urge to splurge
It’s lunch time, you on the bench at crunch time
And one rhyme, can hit you on the punch line
My bullets defy gravity, bust through your chest cavity
With pen point actually, I restructure your anamity
More vultures than I bury, I can cause a catastrophe
Arenas filled to capacity, and you have the audacity
I’ll kill your next-a-kin, be hard to apprehend
Turning corners in the Benz, my world has come to an end

1TK81ximw0KsPGukvrrbvd,Night After Night,Phillip Sandifer,"The Apple is a shallow town
When you're thirty and part
Of the upwardly mobile crowd
So much to say and do
The deal is your God
And the day gets you through
But night after night
The battle for truth goes on
Alone in our heads
Dealing with every wrong
Night after night
The day must be rationalized
In order to deal
With the way we feel
Night after night
A shadow's been trailing D.C
Men who have made it there
Fight in the name of peace
Hearts once sold out to the truth
Now run where the votes are
Knowing they're losing
Night after night
The battle for truth goes on
Alone in our heads
Dealing with every wrong
Night after night
The day must be rationalized
In order to deal
With the way we feel
Night after night
With the truth
We are so condescending
You see, it's an endless debate
Tell me which one
Will you be defending
The truth or the take
Night after night
The battle for truth goes on
It goes on
Alone in our heads
Dealing with every wrong
Night after night
The day must be rationalized
In order to deal
With the way we feel
Night after...
Night after night
The battle for truth
It goes on, it goes on
Alone in our heads
Dealing with every wrong
Night after night
The day must be rationalized
In order to deal
With the way we feel
Night after night

5zugYtCWuCpteLtmSzCySV,B & E,Blaze Ya Dead Homie,"I broke the front window of the house
There wasn't any stirrin' and the lights were still out
I crept through the hole and my feet touched the flo'
And the sound of the wood made a creak from below
Ain't nobody home, I'm alone and in the zone
Rummaging the room for what's yours to make my own
The TVs so sweet, wrap the screen in a sheet
Haul it all to the window, that's one room complete
My B&E

I case the joint (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Get straight to the point (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Lookin' over my back (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Load it all in my sack (Load it all in my sack)

I stepped in toward the back room and heard a noise
It sounded like a dog out chewin' on his toys
And just like a stopwatch, the sound stopped
And in through the door walks a full grown Rott
He looked real fierce, his teeth pierced with a grin
Like you don't know who the fucks house you broken in
I shot him a grin out from the kitchen
I opened up the fridge and said ""here boy, dig on in""
My B&E

I case the joint (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Get straight to the point (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Lookin' over my back (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Load it all in my sack (Load it all in my sack)
I case the joint (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Get straight to the point (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Lookin' over my back (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Load it all in my sack (Load it all in my sack)

Someone's comin', here they come
Someone's comin', here they come
Someone's comin', here they come
Should I start runnin'? Here they come
Someone's comin', here they come
Someone's comin', here they come
Someone's comin', here they come
Should I start runnin'? Here they come
Ooh, false alarm

Continue loadin' goods out the back of the crib
To the truck of the car, I can barely close the lid
Now I'm back in the house, take the picture off the fireplace
Grabbed a crowbar, and I crack open the safe
Snatch the money and the jewelry
This ain't nothin' new to me
Then I see the lights through the window
And I freeze, hear the keys
I flee, I speed up the street
If I'm caught, doin' 5 to 10 stretch like a dream
My B&E

I case the joint (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Get straight to the point (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Lookin' over my back (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Load it all in my sack (Load it all in my sack)
I case the joint (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Get straight to the point (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Lookin' over my back (I'm makin' sure nobody's comin')
Load it all in my sack (Load it all in my sack)

Load it all in my sack, load it all in my sack
Load it all in my sack, load it all in my sack
Load it all in my sack, load it all in my sack
Load it all in my sack, load it all in my sack",success,522381.0,B & E,Blaze Ya Dead Homie,https://genius.com/Blaze-ya-dead-homie-b-and-e-lyrics
