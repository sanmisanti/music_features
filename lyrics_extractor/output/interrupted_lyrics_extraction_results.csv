To numb me and purge me now

Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized

On northern land, as human contraband
Some rico from Jalisco passed her name to the Boss
She stuffed into a truckbed, she clutches her cross
Here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
Of Yanqui guns for blood, debts on the loans
Of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
Of graves hidden, trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

To tear away at the mask

And now she got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
His presence, it terrifies and eclipses her days
No minutes to rest, no moments to pray
And with a whisper he whips her, her soul chained to his will
""My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill""
Her arms jerk, the sisters gather 'round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear (Maria)

Never conquered but here

Now check this out, uh!

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down
Aw shit

Uh!
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh!

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!

For such a simple heart
Can anyone stop

When you are sleeping
I'll pretend it's mine
When they ask me how long
I'm gonna love you

Will always stay true

And Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child, he was born to give
Now what about all the unborn people that will suffer
At the hands of Mr. Right who cares about no other
I see a mother who lets her children use her up
I know a father who just sacrificed his wayward son
I wonder what you give that someone else is needin'

The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay it
With a bet about us, you said that you'd take it
As long as I could, I could not erase it

And I rode alongside you then
And I rode alongside till you lost me there in the open road
And I rode alongside till the honey spread itself so thin
For me to break your bread, for me to take your word
I had to steal it

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)

Down New Mexico way, something about the open road
I knew that he was looking for some Indian blood
And find a little in you find a little in me
We may be on this road but
We're just impostors in this country, you know
So we go along and we said we'd fake it
Feel better with Oliver Stone
Till I almost smacked him, seemed right that night and
I don't know what takes hold out there in the desert cold

All in all, was a pretty nice day

No one's at the door
You suggest a ghost, perhaps a phantom

In Louisiana a turtle fell from the clouds
Some just believe, some only doubt
And some proclaim they've got it all figured out
Some keep their thoughts to themselves
Afraid to come out of their shell
In my heart of hearts
I want to believe that love never fails
And peace will prevail
And hope lives on
If I can get to the deepest part
Inside my heart of hearts
There is a man who used bowling balls
To make a rosary in his yard on the ground
Some people laugh, some only frown
Some shake their heads and wonder what it's about
Some walk around counting prayers
Looking to find faith to spare
Some like to hear themselves talk

Carefully touches
Her unchanging face
Watches her

Bluer than beale street

Junior will be left here all alone
Oh how it worries me so

An angel to brighten up our day
Who will tell him stories and sing him bedtime songs
Who will pray for Junior when I'm gone
Sometimes I can't help but cry
When I look into my Junior's eyes
He reaches out and takes my hand
I know he doesn't understand
A mother's love a son will sorely miss
I've made my peace with everything but this
But that's the thing that keeps me hanging on

We all stood in out pajamas
On that hallowed southern ground
When the flames had turned to ashes
Only blackened bricks remained
And sixteen stately Doric columns
There beneath a veil of gray
And it's a long and slow surrender
Retreating from the past
It's important to remember
To fly the flag half-mast
And look away
I was taught by elders wiser
Love your neighbor, love your God
Never saw a cross on fire
Never saw an angry mob
I saw sweet magnolia blossoms
I chased lightening bugs at night
Never dreaming others saw our way of life
In black and white

Part of me can feel their weight
Part of me believes that mansion

He said ""check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out"", yeah
(Stick it up, man) I'm up and I feel fine
(Stick it up, man) I won't drop till I get mine
(Stick it up, man) I got to find a way to get away today
Stick it up, man, again, again, rewind
Because I am the man (what?)
I am the man (what?
Who's the man?
Try to front like you want to try to understand
But you don't know shit, man
I know that you care (and I know you care)
And I know that you care (and I know you care)
Yeah, I know you care (and I know that, and I know that)
And I know you (and I know you care)
Shit, come on
And I'll go where you want to go, 'cause I feel this way
And I care what you got to say, 'cause I feel this way (so I stepped up and I said I just don't understand)
And I'll go where you want to go, 'cause I feel this way (He said just come and check it out man)
And I care what you got to say, 'cause I feel this way (And I said damn man I just don't understand and he said just come just check it out man)
I said ""damn, man, I just don't understand""
He said ""just come, just check it out, man""
I said ""damn, man, I just don't understand""
He said ""check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out"", man, yeah, come on
Here we go
Hip hop nation, vibe affiliation
All that I need is mind emancipation
Got to find a way to get away
Got to find something to make me want to stay
'Cause, all that I see is shaded
Now I can't even see straight cause I'm faded
Stressed cause of strain and you know that I'm leaving today (so)
And I care what you say, but I feel this way (this way)
And I'll go where you want to go, 'cause I feel this way (come check it out, man)
And I care what you gotta say, 'cause I feel this way (come check it out, man)
Yeah, I can, yeah, I'll go, 'cause I feel the way
I don't care what you gotta say, ('cause I feel this way)",https://genius.com/Zebrahead-feel-this-way-lyrics,success
